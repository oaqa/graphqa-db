This repository consists of two modules :-

1. Knowledge Graph Builder
2. Graph Query Handler

The knowledge graph builder takes a website URL and graph database location as input. It extracts data from the website using web crawling and web scraping techniques and creates a graph database at the mentioned location.

The graph query handler takes in key terms, forms a query and issues the query on the graph database. The results are retrieved and returned.
